This is a drop-in C replacement for Python's gettext.GNUTranslations.  For our
fairly large set of languages and strings, it makes parsing 10x faster.

Just import GNUTranslations from cgettext instead of gettext.

You can safely install this module on PyPy and other implementations where a C
extension is undesirable, and it will simply re-export the built-in class.

The repository includes a small module, test_cgettext, that runs the built-in
Python gettext tests with GNUTranslations monkeypatched.
